# Topic

"Genetic structure and long-term genetic diversity assessment of
Burgundy truffle populations in central Europe"

# Research question(s) and hypotheses

What is the population structure of the truffles? How long do
individuals live? Differences between or within populations?

# Research aims

The Burgundy truffle is an abundant ectomycorrhizal symbiont that occurs
in a wide range of temperate climates. Despite its prized underground
ascocarps, its complex lifecycle and possible response to anthropogenic
climate change are largely known. A citizen science monitoring of
Burgundy truffle ascocarp production was run with a 3-week resolution in
23 natural populations at the center of its European distribution over
up to 11 years. More than 3000 truffles were genotyped using
microsatellite markers to assess the genetic structure and diversity of
these populations in space and time. The aims of this research project
are to assess the population structure, compare intra- and inter
populations and assess the gene flow and persistence of individuals.

# A review of the current state of research

## Truffles in general

True truffles are edible fungi from the phylum Ascomycota and the genus
Tuber. They form symbiotic relationships with various host trees and
produce underground fruiting bodies known as ascocarps or sporocarps
(@bonito2010, @bonito2013, @guevara2013, @reyna2014, @berch2016). There
are over 200 described species of truffles (genus Tuber, family
Tuberaceae) worldwide, and the number is continually increasing.
However, only a small number of these species hold significant
commercial value. In Europe, over 30 truffle species are naturally
found, including some highly valued for their culinary properties, such
as *Tuber magnatum* (Alba white truffle), *Tuber melanosporum* (Périgord
black truffle), and *Tuber aestivum* (Burgundy and summer truffles,
depending on the harvesting period) [@ceruti],
[@boaWildEdibleFungi2004]; [@bonito2010]; [@chevaliera], [@reyna2014a].

As ectomycorrhizal fungi, truffles form symbiotic associations with
roots of a wide range of ectomycorrhizal tree species [@benucci2011],
[@stobbe2012]. They grant their hosts access to water and nutrients,
protect roots from disease and pest, and interact with and sometimes to
the detriment of non-host plants [@gryndler2014]; [@streiblová2012];
[@taschen2020]).

Advancements in molecular biology have significantly improved our
understanding of the evolutionary origins, population dynamics, and
symbiotic relationships of various truffle species. Unlike other
valuable forest mushrooms such as *Boletus* spp., *Laccaria* spp. or
*Cantharellus* spp., which can develop their fruiting bodies in just a
few days [@moore2008]; [@halbwachs2016], truffles grow more slowly
[@pacioni2015]. The exact duration for truffle development and the
number of fruiting body generations within a single growing season
remain largely unknown [@büntgen2017].

"In fact, we simply do not know how selective a harvest is and how well
it represents the actual abundance of fruitbodies since the absence of
evidence is no evidence of absence."
@buntgenEcoarchaeologicalExcavationTechniques2021

## *Tuber aestivum*

*T. aestivum* is indigenous to many European countries and has a
widespread distribution range from Sweden to Spain @stobbe2013, and has
also been found outside Europe in North Africa @jeandroz2008. Since the
1970s, *T. aestivum* as well as some other truffle species have been
successfully cultivated in truffle orchards
@chevalierCultivationBurgundyTruffle.

Research to date has mainly concentrated on its taxonomic status
(@molinierFirstIdentificationPolymorphic2013),
@leonardiTypificationFourMost2021, \@bonitoImprovedResolutionMajor2010,
@bonitoHistoricalBiogeographyDiversification2013), aroma profiles
(@splivalloSmellTrufflesAroma2016, @TruffleVolatilesChemical), and
genetic diversity (@molinierSSRbasedIdentificationGenetic2016,
@molinierFinescaleSpatialGenetic2015, @staubliHiddenFairyRings2022),
including potential links to aroma
(@molinierFinescaleSpatialGenetic2015). Studies have also explored the
cultivation potential and requirements of these species
(@stobbePotentialLimitationsBurgundy2013,
@chevalierCultivationBurgundyTruffle), focusing on soil conditions
(@benucciEctomycorrhizalCommunitiesProductive2011,
@gryndlerDetectionSummerTruffle2011).

The genome sequencing of *T. melanosporum* in 2010
@martinPerigordBlackTruffle2010, as well as numerous other studies of
*T. melanosporum* @TuberMelanosporumMating, *T. magnatum* (Paolocci et
al. 2006;Riccioni et al. 2008;Rubinietal. 2005, 2011a,b) and *T.
indicum* (Belfiori et al. 2013) have revealed that these species are
heterothallic. This has also been confirmed for *T. aestivum*
(@payenChapterSevenTruffle2014). Homothallic species contain both mating
types (MAT) in their genome, which makes them self-fertile, while
heterothallic species present only one of the two types in the MAT locus
@billiardSexOutcrossingMating2012. To achieve its life cycle, a female
type, i.e. ascogonium, has to be fertilized by a strain of the opposite
mating type. In truffles, a fruiting body is composed of peridium, gleba
and ascospores. The gleba is a haploid tissue consisting of the maternal
parent genotype, which is usually also found as mycelia in the
surrounding soil and on nearby ECM root tips
(@muratFinescaleSpatialGenetic2013; @TuberMelanosporumMating).
Ascospores, on the other hand, originate from the recombination of the
maternal and paternal genotypes [@letacon2015].

Based on surveys conducted on hypogeous fungi in the region of Basel,
Switzerland, it has been estimated that *T. aestivum* is one of the most
prevalent mushroom species found in mixed beech forests on calcareous
soils (@schwarzelBEITRAGZURHYPOGAEENFLORA1976). However, despite this
abundance, the harvesting of *T. aestivum* remains limited in many
countries, with legal protections in place in Germany due to its
perceived rarity (@stobbePotentialLimitationsBurgundy2013). This
disparity in abundance estimates is attributed to the limited
understanding of the species' occurrence and distribution, primarily
because of its subterranean life and the challenges associated with
detecting its hypogeous fruit bodies
@moserEcologicalIndicatorsTuber2017.

### Results from WSL

Among Tuber species, *Tuber aestivum* Vittad. has a wide distributional
range being found naturally all over Europe. A study by
@molinierSSRbasedIdentificationGenetic2016 performed large-scale
population genetic analyses in *T. aestivum* and found that fixation
index values between pairs of genetic groups were generally high and
ranged from 0.29 to 0.45. A significant deficit of heterozygosity
indicated a population expansion instead of a recent population
bottleneck, suggesting that *T. aestivum* is not endangered in Europe,
not even in Mediterranean regions. The study suggests that genetically
distinct populations and likely ecotypes within *T. aestivum* are
present.

@molinierFinescaleGeneticStructure2016 found that *T. aestivum* might
follow a ruderal colonization strategy as some genets spread several
hundred meters. This result indicates that, besides sexual spore
dispersal, vegetative growth or spreading by mycelial propagules
contributes to dissemination. They explained that forest characteristics
and disturbances are possible reasons for the observed genetic patterns.

@moserEcologicalIndicatorsTuber2017 found that *T. aestivum* is commonly
found in beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests. The optimal habitats are
characterized by specific soil conditions, such as alkaline pH and high
calcium content. These environmental factors are crucial for the growth
and fructification of the species. The paper underscores the ecological
value of truffle habitats, which support a rich biodiversity. Conserving
these habitats is essential not only for truffle production but also for
maintaining the ecological balance and biodiversity of beech forests.

@buntgenEcoarchaeologicalExcavationTechniques2021 introduced a novel
eco-archaeological approach to study in situ aspects of subterranean
life cycle dynamics and genetic structures of the Burgundy truffle in
three different natural habitats in Baden-Württemberg, southern Germany.
They applied a suite of fine-scale excavation techniques to reveal
high-resolution, spatiotemporal snapshots of the composition, size and
developmental stage of a wide-range of individual truffles.

@steidingerFallSummerTruffle2022 modeled how truffle productivity is
influenced by soil physicochemical, fungal meta-community, climate, and
host tree phenology. Additionally, they characterized the broad species
climatic envelope of European summer truffles. By comparing the
sensitivity of summer truffle fruitbody productivity to interannual
climate trends, they tested whether these center-of-range, keystone
populations are locally sensitized to climate change. The results
are....

Another interesting finding was in a study of
@staubliHiddenFairyRings2022 where they revealed the previously unknown
or hidden fairy rings of *T. aestivum*. Fairy rings are circular
patterns of fungi growth, and discovering them could provide insights
into the distribution and behavior of truffle populations.

# Identification of gaps in the field of research, motivation for the research and justification of the added scientific value for the field of study

Much remains unknown about the life history of these iconic species due
to a lack of available data from natural truffle populations. Many
aspects of the subterranean life cycle of the genus, such as the
formation, duration, maturation and deterioration of their fruitbodies,
remain enigmatic and require innovative scientific endeavours.

# Materials and Methods

## Data collection

To monitor truffle fruitbody production, 24 natural populations of
*Tuber aestivum* located within the central part of its natural
geographic distribution were selected. These populations, ranging from
20 to 1000 m² in size, were identified based on areas with compatible
host trees where trained dogs had previously found *T. aestivum*
fruitbodies. Monitoring was carried out by citizen scientists with
trained dogs every three weeks throughout the year. Each monitoring site
was consistently observed by the same citizen-dog team for the duration
of the project. When the dogs detected belowground fruitbodies, the soil
was partially removed to assess the species identity, mass (in grams),
and maturity level of the truffles. Maturity was categorized into the
following qualitative stages:

1\. Unripe: Characterized by being white, hard, and having no or
indistinct odor.

2\. Semi-ripe: Identified by a light beige to light brown color,
hardness, and an indistinct (nutty) odor.

3\. Ripe: Marked by a brown to dark brown color, hardness, and an
intense odor.

## Molecular preparation

The truffle samples for microsatellite analyses were prepared according
to the protocol previously described by
@molinierFinescaleGeneticStructure2016.

## Genetic analyses

### **Microsatellite Data Analysis**

**Data Preparation**

Before starting the analysis, individuals with two mating types were
already removed (why exactly?) and the data was thoroughly checked for
amplification errors or other issues. Questionable samples were removed.

Raw microsatellite data were imported into R software (version [specify
version]) for analysis. Data were formatted into a genind object or
genclone object, respectively, using the poppr package
\@kamvarPopprPackageGenetic2014, where each row represents an individual
and each column represents a microsatellite locus.

Data manipulation was generally done using the tidyverse
\@wickhamWelcomeTidyverse2019 and visualisations were computed with
ggplot2 \@wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016.

#### Data exploration

Sampling site coordinates were visualized using the ggspatial
\@dunningtonGgspatialSpatialData2023 and rnaturalearth
\@massicotteRnaturalearthWorldMap2024 package.

Various explorative visualisations and tables were produced to gain
insight about the data structure, number of samples per site, data
completeness, location of missing data, number of alleles per locus and
distribution of samples during the whole time.

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**\
PCA will be performed on the microsatellite genind object using the
dudi.pca function from the adegenet package
\@jombartAdegenetPackageMultivariate2008. This function calculates
principal components (PCs) based on the genetic variation present in the
dataset. PCs represent linear combinations of the original variables
(microsatellite alleles) that capture the maximum variance in the data.\
The PCA results will be visualized using scatterplots, with individuals
plotted in the space defined by the first few principal components.
Clustering patterns, if present, will be visually inspected to identify
distinct genetic clusters or population substructure.\
To objectively identify genetic clusters, discriminant analysis of
principal components (DAPC) will be performed using the dapc function
from the adegenet package. DAPC optimally partitions individuals into
clusters based on genetic similarity while maximizing between-group
differences.\
The robustness of identified clusters will be assessed using
cross-validation implemented in the dapc function. The optimal number of
clusters will be determined based on statistical criteria such as the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or cross-validated classification
rates.

#### Identification of repeated multilocus genotypes

Identification of repeated multilocus genotypes (MLGs) involved
assigning an MLG to each fruiting body. To differentiate true clones
from those carrying the same MLG by chance, the probability that
identical MLGs arose from sexual reproduction (Psex) was calculated
using MLGSIM (\@stenbergMlgsimProgramDetecting2003). Psex values were
generated through 10,000 simulations using the Monte Carlo simulation
method. A significant Psex value indicates that multiple copies of the
same MLG arose from asexual reproduction and growth (true clones), while
a non-significant Psex value suggests that the occurrences of a repeated
MLG resulted from sexual reproduction by chance. In such cases, these
occurrences were treated as distinct individuals.

Given the clonality observed, subsequent analyses will be conducted on a
global data set including all individuals (ramet level) and on a
clone-corrected data set including one member of each MLG (simple
clone-corrected dataset).

#### **Genetic Diversity Analysis**

\
To assess genetic diversity within the sampled populations, I will
employ the rarefied Simpson's index. This index accounts for variation
in sample size by randomly subsampling individuals within each
population to a uniform sample size prior to diversity calculation. The
rarefied Simpson's index (D) will be calculated using the formula:

D=1−∑i=1S(ni(ni−1)N(N−1))D = 1 - \sum\_{i=1}\^{S} \left(
\frac{n_i (n_i - 1)}{N(N-1)} \right)D=1−∑i=1S​(N(N−1)ni​(ni​−1)​)

Where:

-   SSS is the total number of different genetic types (alleles or
    genotypes) observed.

-   nin_ini​ is the number of individuals belonging to the ithi\^{th}ith
    genetic type.

-   NNN is the total number of individuals sampled.

**Statistical Analysis:**\
Statistical analyses will be performed using the package "poppr"
\@kamvarPopprPackageGenetic2014 and visualisation will be done using
"ggplot2" \@Ggplot2ElegantGraphics in the statistical software R.
Rarefaction curves were generated to visualize the relationship between
genetic diversity and sample size. Additionally, non-parametric tests
such as Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test were employed to
assess differences in genetic diversity among populations or
environmental gradients.

**Justification for Rarefied Simpson's Index:**\
The rarefied Simpson's index was chosen for its suitability in
addressing the issue of unequal sample sizes commonly encountered in
genetic diversity studies. By rarefying the dataset to a consistent
sample size, biases resulting from differences in sampling effort are
minimized, allowing for more accurate comparisons of diversity levels
among populations. This approach provides a robust measure of genetic
diversity while ensuring that each individual contributes equally to the
analysis, regardless of population size. \@krebsChapter13Species

#### Genetic structure

\
The genetic structure of the truffle populations will be assessed using
the Bayesian clustering method implemented in the STRUCTURE software
\@pritchardDocumentationStructureSoftware. The program uses genotype
data to assign individuals to genetically homogeneous clusters (K) based
on allele frequencies.

On the clone-corrected dataset, the analysis will be set according to
\@staubliHiddenFairyRings2022 with the putative populations range of K =
1–10, under the admixture model with correlated allele frequencies
(Falush et al., 2003), and without a priori information of the location
origin of each sample. We will run the analysis with 10 replicates for
each value of K, a burn-in of 500,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo
iterations, followed by 750,000 iterations.

On the entire dataset, the settings will be taken from
\@molinierSSRbasedIdentificationGenetic2016. That means to investigate
the population subdivision with the Bayesian method implemented in
STRUCTURE. The admixture model with correlated allele frequencies will
be selected as an appropriate option for the analysis. The burn-in
period and Markov Chain Monte Carlo value (MCMC) will be set to 500,000
and 750,000 iterations, respectively, and 20 replicates per K will be
run. As recommended, successive K values (number of populations) from 1
to 10 will be used to obtain the distinct genetic group and to estimate
the number of subpopulations.\
The results of the STRUCTURE analysis will be visualized using STRUCTURE
HARVESTER software.

#### **Persistence of individuals**

Truffle persistence data will be visualized using the ggplot2. Line
plots will be generated to depict the temporal trends in truffle
persistence over the study period. The x-axis represented the sampling
years, while the y-axis represents the individuals or MLGs.

# Expected results

Since Tuber spp. are hypogeous, their propagation mainly depends on
insects and larger animals as spore vectors (Trappe and Claridge 2005).
Hypogeous species are thought to have a shorter distance dispersion
potential than epigeous species, which have air-dispersed spores, with
related effects on the gene flow and genetic structure. The consequence
of a short dispersal distance is greater population differentiation and
isolation by distance at smaller spatial scales for hypogeous fungi such
as Rhizopogon occidentalis, R. vulgaris and Tuber melanosporum (Murat et
al. 2013;Grubisha etal. 2007). A fine-scale population structure
analysis carried out in two T. melanosporum plantations using fruiting
bodies and mycorrhizas demonstrated a profound isolation by distance in
the first 5 m and found that belowground genets had a maximum size ofa
fewmeters (Murat et al. 2013). The observed patterns were assumed to be
a combination of vegetative mycelial growth of a few genets that
persisted for several years and an annual recruitment of new genets via
the ascospores. Intriguingly, genotypes were not spatially randomly
distributed in T. melanosporum plantations and natural fields but rather
occurred in clusters according to their MAT idiomorph (Murat et al.
2013;Rubini etal. 2011a). Such a spatial segregation ofmating types
would decrease the probability that compatible cells meet, which could
be beneficial under the assumption that sex is costly (Selosse et al.
2013). This segregation ofthe mating-type strains raises the question
ofwhere paternal individuals come from and what structures they might
consist of (Le Tacon et al., 2015).
@molinierFinescaleGeneticStructure2016

@molinierFinescaleGeneticStructure2016 determined mating type and simple
sequence repeat (SSR) maternal genotypes of mapped fruiting bodies to
assess their genetic structure within two naturally colonized forest
sites in southern Germany. Forty-one genotypes were identified from 112
fruiting bodies. According to their mating types, the maternal genotypes
were aggregated only in one population. Genotypic diversity of
individuals that mostly were small and occurred in 1 out of 2 years of
sampling was high. Although these results suggested a ruderal
colonization strategy, some genets spread several hundred meters. This
result indicates that, besides sexual spore dispersal, vegetative growth
or spreading by mycelial propagules contributes to dissemination. In one
site, fewer individuals with a tendency to expand genets belonging to
only one genetic group were observed. In the second site, numerous small
individuals were found and were grouped into two clearly differentiated
genetic groups that were spatially intermingled. Forest characteristics
and disturbances are possible reasons for the observed genetic patterns.

# Risk assessment

**Risk Assessment for Truffle Sample Preparation and Data Analysis**

**1. Laboratory Sample Preparation Errors**

**Potential Problems:**

-   **Contamination:** Samples may be contaminated by other DNA sources,
    leading to inaccurate results.

-   **Degradation:** Improper handling or storage can lead to DNA
    degradation.

-   **Incorrect Sample Labeling:** Mislabeling can result in mixing up
    samples, compromising the entire dataset.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

-   Implement strict laboratory protocols for sample handling and
    processing.

-   Use gloves and sterilize equipment to prevent contamination.

-   Store samples at appropriate temperatures to preserve DNA integrity.

-   Double-check labels at multiple stages to ensure accuracy.

**2. Microsatellite Marker Issues**

**Potential Problems:**

-   **Non-Amplification:** Microsatellite markers may fail to amplify
    during PCR, resulting in incomplete data.

-   **Low Polymorphism:** Markers may not be polymorphic enough to
    distinguish between different genotypes.

-   **Primer-Dimer Formation:** Primers may form dimers, reducing the
    efficiency of PCR amplification.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

-   Optimize PCR conditions, including primer concentrations and
    annealing temperatures.

-   Validate markers in a pilot study to ensure they are suitable for
    the target population.

-   Design multiple sets of primers for each microsatellite to increase
    the chances of successful amplification.

**3. Data Analysis Challenges**

**Potential Problems:**

-   **Inconclusive Results:** Genetic patterns may not be clear, making
    it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions.

-   **Software Errors:** Data analysis software may have bugs or may not
    handle the data as expected.

-   **Complex Genetic Structure:** The population may have a complex
    genetic structure that is hard to decipher.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

-   Use multiple software tools and cross-validate results to ensure
    reliability.

-   Train team members thoroughly on data analysis software and methods.

-   Apply robust statistical methods to analyze data, accounting for
    potential complexities in genetic structures.
