## Topic
"Genetic structure and long-term genetic diversity assessment of Burgundy truffle populations in central Europe"

## Research question(s) and hypotheses
Prelim.:
What is the population structure of the truffles?
Are MLGs perennial?
Differences between or within populations? Interactions... etc?

## Research aims
The Burgundy truffle is an abundant ectomycorrhizal symbiont that occurs in a wide range of temperate climates. Despite its prized underground ascocarps, its complex lifecycle and possible response to anthropogenic climate change are largely known.We ran a citizen science monitoring of Burgundy truffle ascocarp production with a 3-week resolution in 23 natural populations at the center of its European distribution over up to 11 years. More than 3000 truffles were genotyped using microsatellite markers to assess the genetic structure and diversity of these populations in space and time.
The aims are to assess the population structure, compare intra- and inter populations and assess the gene flow and perenniality of individuals.

## A review of the current state of research
### Truffles in general


### T. aestivum

### Results from WSL


## Identification of gaps in the field of research, motivation for the research and justification of the added scientific value for the field of study
- Monitoring data rare, unique

## Materials and Methods
- describe data collection
- describe molecular preparation

## Expected results

## Risk assessment

## Project schedule
- Data collection almost finished
- Data analysis: splitting into different parts

## Budget plan
- Costs: personnel, analyses
