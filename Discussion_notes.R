Points for discussion

Non-systematic and nondestructive
harvests are therefore likely dominated by specific aroma
concentrations, fruitbody dimensions and locations, as well as
hunter/dog ability. The aroma profile of truffles seems to be influenced
by individual genotypes @molinier2015, and not by the geographical
origin or maturity level @niimi2021. Since the development of aromas
most likely depends on the presence of specific bacteria
@splivallo2016a, no correlation between gleba colour and aroma intensity
has been reported. Depending on the percentage of fully pigmented
spores, and thus the level of maturity and ripening @molinier2016, the
gleba of Burgundy truffles can vary from white-ochre to dark brown.
Differences in the colour and texture of fruitbodies have been proofed
useful visual criteria for species identification and distinction
@chatin1887, which may otherwise be considered genetically identical,
such as Tuber. aestivum and Tuber uncinatum @molinier2013.
