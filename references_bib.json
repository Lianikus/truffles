  {"id":"buntgenEcoarchaeologicalExcavationTechniques2021","abstract":"Despite its status as a highly-prized and coveted fungi in gastronomy, many aspects of the subterranean life cycle of the Burgundy truffle (Tuber aestivum) are still unknown, because in situ observations of the formation and maturation of truffle fruitbodies remain difficult. Here, we adopted a suite of archaeological fine-scale excavating techniques to provide unique spatiotemporal snapshots of Burgundy truffle growth at three sites in southern Germany. We also recorded the relative position, fresh weight, maturity level and genotype composition of all excavated fruitbodies. Varying by a factor of thousand, the fresh weight of 73 truffle ranged from 0.1 to 103.2 g, with individual maturity levels likely representing different life cycle stages from completely unripe to fully ripe and even decaying. While only a slightly positive relationship between fruitbody weight and maturity level was found, our results suggest that genetically distinct specimens can exhibit different life cycle stages at the same period of time and under the same environmental conditions. We therefore argue that truffles are likely able to grow, mature and ripe simultaneously between early summer and late winter of the following year. Our case study should encourage further eco-archaeological truffle excavations under different biogeographic settings and at different seasons of the year to gain deeper insights into the fungi's subterranean ecology. The expected cross-disciplinary findings will help truffle hunters and farmers to improve their harvest practices and management strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Büntgen","given":"Ulf"},{"family":"Peter","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Tegel","given":"Willy"},{"family":"Stobbe","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Elburg","given":"Rengert"},{"family":"Sproll","given":"Ludger"},{"family":"Molinier","given":"Virginie"},{"family":"Čejka","given":"Tomáš"},{"family":"Isaac","given":"Elizabeth L."},{"family":"Egli","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"buntgenEcoarchaeologicalExcavationTechniques2021","container-title":"Fungal Biology","container-title-short":"Fungal Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.funbio.2021.09.001","ISSN":"1878-6146","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,1]]},"page":"951-961","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Eco-archaeological excavation techniques reveal snapshots of subterranean truffle growth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878614621001148","volume":"125"},
  {"id":"diniz-filhoMantelTestPopulation2013","abstract":"The comparison of genetic divergence or genetic distances, estimated by pairwise FST and related statistics, with geographical distances by Mantel test is one of the most popular approaches to evaluate spatial processes driving population structure. There have been, however, recent criticisms and discussions on the statistical performance of the Mantel test. Simultaneously, alternative frameworks for data analyses are being proposed. Here, we review the Mantel test and its variations, including Mantel correlograms and partial correlations and regressions. For illustrative purposes, we studied spatial genetic divergence among 25 populations of Dipteryx alata (“Baru”), a tree species endemic to the Cerrado, the Brazilian savannas, based on 8 microsatellite loci. We also applied alternative methods to analyze spatial patterns in this dataset, especially a multivariate generalization of Spatial Eigenfunction Analysis based on redundancy analysis. The different approaches resulted in similar estimates of the magnitude of spatial structure in the genetic data. Furthermore, the results were expected based on previous knowledge of the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying genetic variation in this species. Our review shows that a careful application and interpretation of Mantel tests, especially Mantel correlograms, can overcome some potential statistical problems and provide a simple and useful tool for multivariate analysis of spatial patterns of genetic divergence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Diniz-Filho","given":"José Alexandre F."},{"family":"Soares","given":"Thannya N."},{"family":"Lima","given":"Jacqueline S."},{"family":"Dobrovolski","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Landeiro","given":"Victor Lemes"},{"family":"Campos Telles","given":"Mariana Pires","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Rangel","given":"Thiago F."},{"family":"Bini","given":"Luis Mauricio"}],"citation-key":"diniz-filhoMantelTestPopulation2013","container-title":"Genetics and Molecular Biology","container-title-short":"Genet Mol Biol","DOI":"10.1590/S1415-47572013000400002","ISSN":"1415-4757","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12]]},"page":"475-485","PMCID":"PMC3873175","PMID":"24385847","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Mantel test in population genetics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3873175/","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"elhaikPrincipalComponentAnalyses2022","abstract":"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate analysis that reduces the complexity of datasets while preserving data covariance. The outcome can be visualized on colorful scatterplots, ideally with only a minimal loss of information. PCA applications, implemented in well-cited packages like EIGENSOFT and PLINK, are extensively used as the foremost analyses in population genetics and related fields (e.g., animal and plant or medical genetics). PCA outcomes are used to shape study design, identify, and characterize individuals and populations, and draw historical and ethnobiological conclusions on origins, evolution, dispersion, and relatedness. The replicability crisis in science has prompted us to evaluate whether PCA results are reliable, robust, and replicable. We analyzed twelve common test cases using an intuitive color-based model alongside human population data. We demonstrate that PCA results can be artifacts of the data and can be easily manipulated to generate desired outcomes. PCA adjustment also yielded unfavorable outcomes in association studies. PCA results may not be reliable, robust, or replicable as the field assumes. Our findings raise concerns about the validity of results reported in the population genetics literature and related fields that place a disproportionate reliance upon PCA outcomes and the insights derived from them. We conclude that PCA may have a biasing role in genetic investigations and that 32,000-216,000 genetic studies should be reevaluated.

Colonization of non-host plants have occasionally been described, but its intensity and functional significance in complex plant communities remain generally unknown. Here, the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungus Tuber aestivum was measured in the roots of host and non-host (non-ectomycorrhizal) plants in a naturally occurring T. aestivum colony using a quantitative PCR approach. The roots of non-host plant species found inside the brûlé area were extensively colonized by T. aestivum mycelium, although the levels were significantly lower than those found in host Carpinus betulus roots. However, fungal biomass concentration in the non-host roots was one to two orders of magnitude higher than that in the surrounding soil. This indicates existence of an important biotic interaction between T. aestivum mycelium and the non-host, mostly herbaceous plants. Roots, either host or non-host, thus probably constitute hot spots of T. aestivum activity in the soil ecosystem with as yet uncovered functional significance.","author":[{"family":"Gryndler","given":"Milan"},{"family":"Cerná","given":"Lucie"},{"family":"Bukovská","given":"Petra"},{"family":"Hršelová","given":"Hana"},{"family":"Jansa","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"gryndlerTuberAestivumAssociation2014","container-title":"Mycorrhiza","container-title-short":"Mycorrhiza","DOI":"10.1007/s00572-014-0580-9","ISSN":"1432-1890","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11]]},"language":"eng","page":"603-610","PMID":"24756631","source":"PubMed","title":"Tuber aestivum association with non-host roots","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

We developed the R package poppr providing unique tools for analysis of data from admixed, clonal, mixed, and/or sexual populations. Currently, poppr can be used for dominant/codominant and haploid/diploid genetic data. Data can be imported from several formats including GenAlEx formatted text files and can be analyzed on a user-defined hierarchy that includes unlimited levels of subpopulation structure and clone censoring. New functions include calculation of Bruvo's distance for microsatellites, batch-analysis of the index of association with several indices of genotypic diversity, and graphing including dendrograms with bootstrap support and minimum spanning networks. While functions for genotypic diversity and clone censoring are specific for clonal populations, several functions found in poppr are also valuable to analysis of any populations.

  {"id":"legendreComparisonMantelTest2010","abstract":"The Mantel test is widely used to test the linear or monotonic independence of the elements in two distance matrices. It is one of the few appropriate tests when the hypothesis under study can only be formulated in terms of distances; this is often the case with genetic data. In particular, the Mantel test has been widely used to test for spatial relationship between genetic data and spatial layout of the sampling locations. We describe the domain of application of the Mantel test and derived forms. Formula development demonstrates that the sum-of-squares (SS) partitioned in Mantel tests and regression on distance matrices differs from the SS partitioned in linear correlation, regression and canonical analysis. Numerical simulations show that in tests of significance of the relationship between simple variables and multivariate data tables, the power of linear correlation, regression and canonical analysis is far greater than that of the Mantel test and derived forms, meaning that the former methods are much more likely than the latter to detect a relationship when one is present in the data. Examples of difference in power are given for the detection of spatial gradients. Furthermore, the Mantel test does not correctly estimate the proportion of the original data variation explained by spatial structures. The Mantel test should not be used as a general method for the investigation of linear relationships or spatial structures in univariate or multivariate data. Its use should be restricted to tests of hypotheses that can only be formulated in terms of distances.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Legendre","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Fortin","given":"Marie-Josée"}],"citation-key":"legendreComparisonMantelTest2010","container-title":"Molecular Ecology Resources","DOI":"10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02866.x","ISSN":"1755-0998","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd","page":"831-844","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Comparison of the Mantel test and alternative approaches for detecting complex multivariate relationships in the spatial analysis of genetic data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-0998.2010.02866.x","volume":"10"},

Forty-one genotypes were identified from 112 fruiting bodies. According to their mating types, the maternal genotypes were aggregated only in one population. Genotypic diversity of individuals that mostly were small and occurred in 1 out of 2 years of sampling was high. Although these results suggested a ruderal colonization strategy, some genets spread several hundred meters. This result indicates that, besides sexual spore dispersal, vegetative growth or spreading by mycelial propagules contributes to dissemination. In one site, fewer individuals with a tendency to expand genets belonging to only one genetic group were observed. In the second site, numerous small individuals were found and were grouped into two clearly differentiated genetic groups that were spatially intermingled. Forest characteristics and disturbances are possible reasons for the observed genetic patterns.

The vegetation composition of truffle sites exhibits a high proportion of herb and shrub species that are indicators of a warm and dry climate, alkaline soil, and open tree canopy and thus typically occur in thermophilous FCO communities on calcareous bedrock. We conclude that T. aestivum is associated with a set of key species in addition to known host species. Based on their floristic composition, we identified FCO forest communities with high and low suitability for T. aestivum.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Moser","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Büntgen","given":"Ulf"},{"family":"Molinier","given":"Virginie"},{"family":"Peter","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Sproll","given":"Ludger"},{"family":"Stobbe","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"Tegel","given":"Willy"},{"family":"Egli","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"moserEcologicalIndicatorsTuber2017","container-title":"Fungal Ecology","container-title-short":"Fungal Ecology","DOI":"10.1016/j.funeco.2017.06.002","ISSN":"1754-5048","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10,1]]},"page":"59-66","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Ecological indicators of <i>Tuber aestivum</i> habitats in temperate European beech forests","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1754504817300776","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"putmanChallengesAnalysisInterpretation2014","abstract":"Advancing technologies have facilitated the ever-widening application of genetic markers such as microsatellites into new systems and research questions in biology. In light of the data and experience accumulated from several years of using microsatellites, we present here a literature review that synthesizes the limitations of microsatellites in population genetic studies. With a focus on population structure, we review the widely used fixation (FST) statistics and Bayesian clustering algorithms and find that the former can be confusing and problematic for microsatellites and that the latter may be confounded by complex population models and lack power in certain cases. Clustering, multivariate analyses, and diversity-based statistics are increasingly being applied to infer population structure, but in some instances these methods lack formalization with microsatellites. Migration-specific methods perform well only under narrow constraints. We also examine the use of microsatellites for inferring effective population size, changes in population size, and deeper demographic history, and find that these methods are untested and/or highly context-dependent. Overall, each method possesses important weaknesses for use with microsatellites, and there are significant constraints on inferences commonly made using microsatellite markers in the areas of population structure, admixture, and effective population size. To ameliorate and better understand these constraints, researchers are encouraged to analyze simulated datasets both prior to and following data collection and analysis, the latter of which is formalized within the approximate Bayesian computation framework. We also examine trends in the literature and show that microsatellites continue to be widely used, especially in non-human subject areas. This review assists with study design and molecular marker selection, facilitates sound interpretation of microsatellite data while fostering respect for their practical limitations, and identifies lessons that could be applied toward emerging markers and high-throughput technologies in population genetics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Putman","given":"Alexander I."},{"family":"Carbone","given":"Ignazio"}],"citation-key":"putmanChallengesAnalysisInterpretation2014","container-title":"Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1002/ece3.1305","ISSN":"2045-7758","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"4399-4428","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Challenges in analysis and interpretation of microsatellite data for population genetic studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ece3.1305","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"qinLifeCyclePhylogeography2022","abstract":"True truffle (Tuber spp.) is one group of ascomycetes with great economic importance. During the last 30 years, numerous fine-scale population genetics studies were conducted on different truffle species, aiming to answer several key questions regarding their life cycles; these questions are important for their cultivation. It is now evident that truffles are heterothallic, but with a prevalent haploid lifestyle. Strains forming ectomycorrhizas and germinating ascospores act as maternal and paternal partners respectively. At the same time, a number of large-scale studies were carried out, highlighting the influences of the last glaciation and river isolations on the genetic structure of truffles. A retreat to southern refugia during glaciation, and a northward expansion post glaciation, were revealed in all studied European truffles. The Mediterranean Sea, acting as a barrier, has led to the existence of several refugia in different peninsulas for a single species. Similarly, large rivers in southwestern China act as physical barriers to gene flow for truffles in this region. Further studies can pay special attention to population genetics of species with a wide distribution range, such as T. himalayense, and the correlation between truffle genetic structure and the community composition of truffle-associated bacteria.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Qin","given":"Jiao"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Bang"}],"citation-key":"qinLifeCyclePhylogeography2022","container-title":"Genes","container-title-short":"Genes (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/genes13010145","ISSN":"2073-4425","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,14]]},"page":"145","PMCID":"PMC8775154","PMID":"35052485","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Life Cycle and Phylogeography of True Truffles","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8775154/","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"roswellConceptualGuideMeasuring2021","abstract":"Three metrics of species diversity – species richness, the Shannon index and the Simpson index – are still widely used in ecology, despite decades of valid critiques leveled against them. Developing a robust diversity metric has been challenging because, unlike many variables ecologists measure, the diversity of a community often cannot be estimated in an unbiased way based on a random sample from that community. Over the past decade, ecologists have begun to incorporate two important tools for estimating diversity: coverage and Hill diversity. Coverage is a method for equalizing samples that is, on theoretical grounds, preferable to other commonly used methods such as equal-effort sampling, or rarefying datasets to equal sample size. Hill diversity comprises a spectrum of diversity metrics and is based on three key insights. First, species richness and variants of the Shannon and Simpson indices are all special cases of one general equation. Second, richness, Shannon and Simpson can be expressed on the same scale and in units of species. Third, there is no way to eliminate the effect of relative abundance from estimates of any of these diversity metrics, including species richness. Rather, a researcher must choose the relative sensitivity of the metric towards rare and common species, a concept which we describe as ‘leverage.' In this paper we explain coverage and Hill diversity, provide guidelines for how to use them together to measure species diversity, and demonstrate their use with examples from our own data. We show why researchers will obtain more robust results when they estimate the Hill diversity of equal-coverage samples, rather than using other methods such as equal-effort sampling or traditional sample rarefaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Roswell","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Dushoff","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Winfree","given":"Rachael"}],"citation-key":"roswellConceptualGuideMeasuring2021","container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/oik.07202","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"321-338","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A conceptual guide to measuring species diversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/oik.07202","volume":"130"},
  {"id":"schneider-maunouryTwoEctomycorrhizalTruffles2020","abstract":"Serendipitous findings and studies on Tuber species suggest that some ectomycorrhizal fungi, beyond their complex interaction with ectomycorrhizal hosts, also colonise roots of nonectomycorrhizal plants in a loose way called endophytism. Here, we investigate endophytism of T. melanosporum and T. aestivum. We visualised endophytic T. melanosporum hyphae by fluorescent in situ hybridisation on nonectomycorrhizal plants. For the two Tuber species, microsatellite genotyping investigated the endophytic presence of the individuals whose mating produced nearby ascocarps. We quantified the expression of four T. aestivum genes in roots of endophyted, non-ectomycorrhizal plants. Tuber melanosporum hyphae colonised the apoplast of healthy roots, confirming endophytism. Endophytic Tuber melanosporum and T. aestivum contributed to nearby ascocarps, but only as maternal parents (forming the flesh). Paternal individuals (giving only genes found in meiotic spores of ascocarps) were not detected. Gene expression of T. aestivum in non-ectomycorrhizal plants confirmed a living status. Tuber species, and likely other ectomycorrhizal fungi found in nonectomycorrhizal plant roots in this study, can be root endophytes. This is relevant for the ecology (brûlé formation) and commercial production of truffles. Evolutionarily speaking, endophytism may be an ancestral trait in some ectomycorrhizal fungi that evolved from root endophytes.","author":[{"family":"Schneider-Maunoury","given":"Laure"},{"family":"Deveau","given":"Aurélie"},{"family":"Moreno","given":"Myriam"},{"family":"Todesco","given":"Flora"},{"family":"Belmondo","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Murat","given":"Claude"},{"family":"Courty","given":"Pierre-Emmanuel"},{"family":"Jąkalski","given":"Marcin"},{"family":"Selosse","given":"Marc-André"}],"citation-key":"schneider-maunouryTwoEctomycorrhizalTruffles2020","container-title":"The New Phytologist","container-title-short":"New Phytol","DOI":"10.1111/nph.16321","ISSN":"1469-8137","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"2542-2556","PMID":"31733103","source":"PubMed","title":"Two ectomycorrhizal truffles, <i>Tuber melanosporum</i> and <i>T. aestivum</i>, endophytically colonise roots of non-ectomycorrhizal plants in natural environments","type":"article-journal","volume":"225"},
  {"id":"staubliHiddenFairyRings2022","abstract":"Burgundy truffles are heterothallic ascomycetes that grow in symbiosis with trees. Despite their esteemed belowground fruitbodies, the species’ complex lifecycle is still not fully understood. Here, we present the genetic patterns in three natural Burgundy truffle populations based on genotyped fruitbodies, ascospore extracts and ectomycorrhizal root tips using microsatellites and the mating-type locus. Distinct genetic structures with high relatedness in close vicinity were found for females (forming the fruitbodies) and males (fertilizing partner as inferred from ascospore extracts), with high genotypic diversity and annual turnover of males, suggesting that ephemeral male mating partners are germinating ascospores from decaying fruitbodies. The presence of hermaphrodites and the interannual persistence of a few males suggest that persistent mycelia may sporadically also act as males. Only female or hermaphroditic individuals were detected on root tips. At one site, fruitbodies grew in a fairy ring formed by a large female individual that showed an outward growth rate of 30 cm per year, with the mycelium decaying within the ring and being fertilized by over 50 male individuals. While fairy ring structures have never been shown for truffles, the genetics of Burgundy truffle populations support a similar reproductive biology as those of other highly prized truffles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Staubli","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Imola","given":"Lea"},{"family":"Dauphin","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Molinier","given":"Virginie"},{"family":"Pfister","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Piñuela","given":"Yasmine"},{"family":"Schürz","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Sproll","given":"Ludger"},{"family":"Steidinger","given":"Brian S."},{"family":"Stobbe","given":"Uli"},{"family":"Tegel","given":"Willy"},{"family":"Büntgen","given":"Ulf"},{"family":"Egli","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Peter","given":"Martina"}],"citation-key":"staubliHiddenFairyRings2022","container-title":"Environmental Microbiology","container-title-short":"Environmental Microbiology","DOI":"10.1111/1462-2920.16131","ISSN":"1462-2912, 1462-2920","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"language":"en","page":"6376-6391","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hidden fairy rings and males—Genetic patterns of natural Burgundy truffle ( <i>Tuber aestivum</i> Vittad.) populations reveal new insights into its life cycle","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.16131","volume":"24"},
  {"id":"steidingerFallSummerTruffle2022","abstract":"Global warming is pushing populations outside their range of physiological tolerance. According to the environmental envelope framework, the most vulnerable populations occur near the climatic edge of their species' distributions. In contrast, populations from the climatic center of the species range should be relatively buffered against climate warming. We tested this latter prediction using a combination of linear mixed effects and machine learning algorithms on an extensive, citizen-scientist generated dataset on the fruitbody productivity of the Burgundy (aka summer) truffle (Tuber aestivum Vittad.), a keystone, ectomycorrhizal tree-symbiont occurring on a wide range of temperate climates. T. aestivum's fruitbody productivity was monitored at 3-week resolution over up to 8 continuous years at 20 sites distributed in the climatic center of its European distribution in southwest Germany and Switzerland. We found that T. aestivum fruitbody production is more sensitive to summer drought than would be expected from the breadth of its species' climatic niche. The monitored populations occurring nearly 5°C colder than the edge of their species' climatic distribution. However, interannual fruitbody productivity (truffle mass year−1) fell by a median loss of 22% for every 1°C increase in summer temperature over a site's 30-year mean. Among the most productive monitored populations, the temperature sensitivity was even higher, with single summer temperature anomalies of 3°C sufficient to stop fruitbody production altogether. Interannual truffle productivity was also related to the phenology of host trees, with 22 g less truffle mass for each 1-day reduction in the length of the tree growing season. Increasing summer drought extremes are therefore likely to reduce fruiting among summer truffle populations throughout Central Europe. Our results suggest that European T. aestivum may be a mosaic of vulnerable populations, sensitive to climate-driven declines at lower thresholds than implied by its species distribution model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Steidinger","given":"Brian S."},{"family":"Büntgen","given":"Ulf"},{"family":"Stobbe","given":"Uli"},{"family":"Tegel","given":"Willy"},{"family":"Sproll","given":"Ludger"},{"family":"Haeni","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Moser","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Bagi","given":"István"},{"family":"Bonet","given":"José-Antonio"},{"family":"Buée","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Dauphin","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Martínez-Peña","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Molinier","given":"Virginie"},{"family":"Zweifel","given":"Roman"},{"family":"Egli","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Peter","given":"Martina"}],"citation-key":"steidingerFallSummerTruffle2022","container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.16424","ISSN":"1365-2486","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022 The Authors.
